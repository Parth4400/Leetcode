approach 1
------------------------------------------------
as we need K element than we can think in the direction
​
like if any element that is greater than the current top element and we already have k element in priority queue than we dont need that element
​
if element is less and size becomes greater than k than we need to delete than current top element
​
so with above we can solve this question using priority queue

apporach 2
---------------------------------------------------
instead of counting 1 in a linear fashion we can use binary search to get index till there are one1
