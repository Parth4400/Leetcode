In this question one way is to generate all possible scenario using recursion
or think in this direction that what could be last step to reach target
​
let start=x  and target= y
​
so two cases are possible is Y is even or Y is odd
​
if Y is odd than last step is always decrement
and if Y is even than last step is Y/2
​
so this way we can greddly solve our question
